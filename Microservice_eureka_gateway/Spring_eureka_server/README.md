# Eureka Server Application

You can think of it as a structure that keeps a list of applications running on the platform. Each microservice application registers itself to Eureka Server. Eureka Server has a mechanism that periodically sends requests to applications and checks whether they are alive or not. If the application is not standing, it is automatically deleted from the list.
